## Introduction 

The purpose of this Prework unit is to get you "warmed up" for the main event, your 12-week immersive course with TIY. It's to allow you to come to class on day 1, ready and prepared to get started right away. Take your time to go through this material, but make sure you do get through it all. Remember that whatever you can absorb here, you will not need to catch up to during the first few days of class. Preparation is a key to success, and this is your chance to prepare to succeed in your 12-week class! 

## Computer Setup 
### Xcode and iOS

You should download Xcode 8.2 (or later) to your Mac before arriving for class. Preparing ahead will save class time. You should also run Software Update (available from the menu on your Mac) and install any available updates for OS X or Xcode.

### Programming Languages: Objective C and Swift 

What's a programming language, you may be wondering? 

It's the way we, humans, communicate with computers. Just as I'm communicating with you in English at the moment, and not Spanish, Mandarin or French, there are also many programming languages we could use to communicate with computers. For this class, we will use Swift as our primary programming language, although we will touch on Objective C as well. 

When you write words in a programming language, there are steps that need to take place in order to translate those words into the computer's native language. We will delve into that as well, but for now, just know that you need something called a "development kit" in order to program in a specific language. 

If you have successfully downloaded and installed Xcode, you should be all set to work with both Objective C and Swift.

### Done with initial setup
Your computer is now configured with the essential tools you need to be able to start creating computer programs in Xcode! We will get started doing just that on Day 1, so make sure you reach out to me (tj@theironyard.com) if you had issues with any of the steps above. 

## Homework
Now that your own computer is set up properly, there are a few more things for you to do in order to prepare for Day 1

### Start Learning the Basics
[The Swift Programming Language (Swift 3)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)
In  
	- Read and work through 
	
		1. The Basics
		2. Basic Operators
		3. Strings and Characters
		4. Collection Types

It is alright if you have difficulty and do not finish, the important part is that you read at least chapters 1 and 2. 

### Learn the basics of "version control"
Imagine writing a letter to a friend you care about a lot. You have things to say, but you want to choose your words carefully. "Version Control" allows you to save your letter every time you think you've gotten to a good point. You can then continue writing it later, come back to a previous version or ask another friend to review it for you and make their own changes.

The system we will be using for version control is called "Git": 

1. [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on your computer (accept all the defaults)
2. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (GitHub is the most popular Git host on the internet)
3. Work through the [Try GitHub](https://try.github.io/) course on how to use Git

Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name to your GitHub profile, as that will help me learn your name. 

## Deliverables
Send me an email (tj@theironyard.com) with the following: 

1. Your GitHub username
2. Any questions (absolutely any questions) you have from going through the above
3. Your thoughts on what you think is going to be most difficult for you during this 12-week immersive iOS class
